# Object Frame Annotation Demo

This repository contains a frontend-only demo that shows how an annotation operator could group identical frames before sending them to a backend service.

## Running the demo

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the grid to select identical frames, then click **Submit group**. The submitted frames disappear from the batch.
3. When a batch is finished, the next mock batch automatically loads. Console logs show simulated fetch and submit events.
